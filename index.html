        <p id="believe">The picture to the left is titled “I believe” and was something I did with the concept of people in the military and how it affects the people they leave back home. This is a conceptual peace that gives the feeling of distance yet connection. Even when people’s lives take them in different directions, we remain one. This was pulled from some personal experiences but I believe that this is a feeling everyone can relate to and has experienced.</p>

        <img src="img/wall.JPG" alt="thumb" class="wall"/>  

        <p id="wall">This painting of the lightning storm was done on a wall with the proportions of 90in by 151in. The mosaic was done with premium latex paint. I enjoyed doing this piece because it was at such a large scale and it required a different level of painting skill then canvas. I was able to be a little more detailed due to the size.</p>

        <img src="img/girl.JPG" alt="thumb" class="girl"/>  

        <p id="girl">The picture of the ballerina is an acrylic imitation of an old famous acrylic painter, whose name eludes me at the moment but I will add when I remember. This was an assignment for an acrylic painting class: chose a painter and one of their works and redo it to the best of our ability. I am very proud of how this painting tuned out and really encouraged me to continue my journey in painting and acrylics.</p>
